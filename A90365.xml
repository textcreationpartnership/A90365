            <title>Pelagos. Nec inter vivos, nec inter mortuos, neither amongst the living, nor amongst the dead. Or, An improvement of the sea, upon the nine nautical verses in the 107. Psalm; wherein is handled I. The several, great, and many hazzards, that mariners do meet withall, in stormy and tempestuous seas. II. Their many, several, miraculous, and stupendious deliverances out of all their helpless, and shiftless distressess [sic]. III. A very full, and delightful description of all those many various, and multitudinous objects, which they behold in their travels (through the Lords Creation) both on sea, in sea, and on land. viz. all sorts and kinds of fish, foul, and beasts, whether wilde, or tame; all sorts of trees, and fruits; all sorts of people, cities, towns, and countries; with many profitable, and useful rules, and instructions for them that use the seas. / By Daniel Pell, preacher of the Word.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I hope
<pb facs="tcp:115438:14"/>
that your <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> will bee ſo minded too. I wiſh this piece may prove as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to you in the reading, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing, as <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s Muſick was to the ſtones, and beaſts of the field, to their hearing, of whom Hiſtory ſays, that they were not able to ſtay in their center, nor continue in their ſtations, but ſtart up and dance after it. <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> relate, how ſtones followed <hi>Amphion</hi> to the <hi>Theban</hi> walls.

            <p n="1">1.

Mee thinks I wonder why people are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:115438:14"/>
ſotitſh now a days. I hear neither any in the City, nor the Country ſay, that they are weary of the Sun for its ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the air in which they breath, of their food from whence they have their nouriſhment, nor of their rayment, and apparrel, which keeps off the cold from them, why then of the Word? What wrong has the Goſpel done them? or the painful, and Godly Miniſtry in this Land, who preach themſelves to their graves for the good of ſoules? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were the Goſpel down (as our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Atheiſts could wiſh it) wee ſhould long for it as much again, as thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do for the <hi>Sun,</hi> of whom <hi>Procopius</hi> reports, that near to the <hi>Pole</hi> where the night continues many moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Inhabitants in the end of ſuch a long night, when the <hi>Sun</hi> draws near to make its appearance to them, will get up into the tops of all high trees, and Mountains, ſtriving who ſhould have the firſt ſight of that glorious lampe, and caeleſtial luminary, that is ſet in the Heavens, for the comfort of the world, and no ſooner do they ſee it, but they dreſs themſelves in their beſt apparrel, as rejoycing at its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, filling the air with many loud acclamations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is a tenderneſs of heart, and ſpirit in you, mourning for and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, which renders you Elect, holy, and beloved amongſt the Saints that
<pb facs="tcp:115438:15"/>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That you make it your conſtant care, and buſineſs, to look to your life, and converſation; and I do know it, that it is the deſire of you ſoul, that it ſhould bee ſuch, and in ſuch a way of holineſs, as does become the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is the great care, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of your ſoul, that all under you ſhould bee engaged in the daily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſervice of God. <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.15. <hi>But as for mee and my houſe, wee will ſerve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That you are a diſcourager of what you apprehend to bee evil, in your family. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Hee that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> Were all Families ſo ordered, it would bee better both in the City, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the whole Land, than it is at this day. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Every wiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man buildeth her houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That you are exemplary in your Family; and truly it is good ſo to bee; if the Mountains overflow with waters, the Valleys are the better for it, and if the head bee full of ill humours, the whole body fares the worſe for it. Give mee leave now, my much <hi>Honoured Lady,</hi> to preſent a few things to you, which may tarry with you when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may call mee from you.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:115438:15"/>1. Think of your dying day;<note place="margin">It is ſaid, that there ſtands a <hi>Globe</hi> of the world at the one end of the <hi>Library</hi> in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> and a <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton</hi> of a man at the other, it ſeems they that go into that <hi>Library</hi> need not ſtand long to ſtudy out a good leſſon. What if a man were <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Lady, King or Queen,</hi> of all the known parts of the world, yet muſt hee dye.</note> I like not the Proverb, I no more thought of it, than I did of my dying day. It is written of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> called <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> that they were ſo much given to think of their latter end, that they had their graves alwaies open before their gates, that both going out, and coming in, they might bee mindful of their death.</p>
            <p>There was once a diſcourſe betwixt a <hi>Citizen</hi> and a <hi>Mariner,</hi> my <hi>Anceſtours</hi> ſaid the <hi>Mariner,</hi> were all Sea-men, and all of them died at Sea, my Father, my grand Father, and my great grand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were all buried in the Sea; then ſayes the Citizen, what great cauſe have you when you ſet out to Sea, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your death? I but ſays the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner</hi> to the <hi>Citizen,</hi> where I pray did your Father, and your grand Father die? why ſaies hee, they died all of them in their beds; truly then ſaies the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner</hi> to the <hi>Citizen,</hi> what a care had you need to have every night, when you go to bed, to think of your bed as a grave, and the clothes that cover you as the earth that muſt one day bee thrown upon you? You are wiſe, and know how to apply it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Lay up treaſure in Heaven; God
<pb facs="tcp:115438:16"/>
has done much for you, in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the riches, honours, dignities, and great things of this life upon you, by making you taller by the head and ſhoulders than thouſands, both in City, and Country are. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.19, 20. Is a Scripture I would commend to your leaſurable conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed of the bewitching ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, entertainments, and the deluding and heart-inſinuating great things of this world. It was a good ſaying of <hi>Luther</hi> (I hope your <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> will make it yours) when offered great things, that hee proteſted to the Lord hee would not bee put off with the things of this life for his portion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Men of the world have their portion in this life;</hi> That is all it ſeems, that ever they are like to have. The <hi>Rubenites (Numb.</hi> 23.) having taken a liking of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which was firſt conquered, becauſe it was commodious for the feeding of their Cattel, though it was far from the <hi>Temple</hi> where they might have fed their ſouls, to enjoy it, they renounced all intereſts in the Land of Promiſe. It is ſaid of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> that came out of the bottomleſs pit, that they were like unto Horſes, and on their heads were as it were Crowns of gold, and their faces were as the faces of men, their hairs, as the hair of women, their teeth, as it were the teeth of Lyons, <hi>&amp;c. (Rev.</hi> 9.7, 8.) in which Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:115438:16"/>
wee have <hi>quaſi</hi> Horſes, <hi>quaſi</hi> Crowns, <hi>quaſi</hi> faces, <hi>quaſi</hi> teeth and <hi>quaſi</hi> hairs of men. In part, ſuch are all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and comforts of this life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Bee much in prayer, hard, and private wreſtling with God in your cloſer for Heaven, and Salavation. If a man were aſſured that there were a great purchaſe in <hi>Spain, Turkey, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. or ſome other remote parts, would hee not run, ride, ſail, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the dangers, and hazzards of the Sea, and of his enemies alſo, if need were, that hee might come to the enjoyment and poſſeſſion thereof? Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is better than Earth, and a life in glory, than a life in this ſinful World; and that you may prefer that above this, in this lower world, and may alſo live, and bee with the Father and the Lamb in the higheſt glory (when this life is ended) for ever more, ſhall bee the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prayer of him</p>

            <p>What Art or Science is there in the world that outſtrips this? Let them come forth to match her.

his Paſtoral Staff, and the Hobnails of his ſhoes did ſtick in a piece of ground where <hi>Loadſtones</hi> were, inſomuch that he was very hard put to it to remove his feet from the place he ſtood upon, and ſo ſtanding admiring what ſecret vertue there ſhould be in the place he ſtood on, or in the ſtones that were under his feet, he took it up, and made report of it, but none was there in all <hi>Magneſia,</hi> whether far or near, that knew the right uſe of it.</p>

But let that man know that lets the Sun go down upon his wrath, he takes the Devil to bed with him.</note> I have obſerved it, that many men do needleſly fret, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex themſelves when they ſee but two talking or ſmiling, and now and then caſting an eye upon them, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceit within themſelves that they are their diſcourſe, and the object of their ſcornful obſervation.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Contain your bodies in quiet, and your tongues in ſilence,</hi> becauſe the ſtirring, and agitation of the body, and ſtamping, and flinging about,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that it was the cuſtome of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholars, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that they had been at odds, jarring &amp; jangling in their diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun ſet, would kiſs &amp; ſhake hands as they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the School.

The walking of the tongue will keep in that paſſionate heat that uſually ſtarts up in the heart, which otherwiſe would evaporate its ſelf, and dye. Silence is an admirable cooler to all indignities and affronts. Would Sea-men take this advice, there would not be ſuch wording of it, as oftentimes there is amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Sea-men would live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably on ſhip-board, and ſeek the peace of the ſhips they go in; let them then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, <hi>give reaſon leave to interpoſe and debate.</hi> It was very good advice that was given to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, when the object and occaſions of choler
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115438:98"/>
were in his eye,<note place="margin">
                     <p>Angry fools in former times were counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to look themſelves in a glaſs. If Sea-men did but ſee their faces when they are angry, they would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them when they are calm and quiet. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. <hi>Latius regnes avidum doman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Spiritum, quam ſi Lybiam remouis Gadibus jungas.</hi> Horat. <hi>Od.</hi> l. 2.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> call anger <hi>Aph,</hi> becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the noſe riſeth, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour changeth, the tongue ſtammereth, the teeth gnaſh, and the hands clap, the feet ſtamp, the pulſe beats, the heart pants, the whole man ſwells like a Toad, and glares like the Devil.</p>
                  </note> that hee ſhould not bee moved before hee had pronounced over the letters of the Alphabet. When Sea-men give the reigns unto their paſſions, it beats out of doors, and out of their brains, both all reaſon, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Sea-men would live comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on ſhipboard, and ſeek the peace, and welfare of the ſhips they ſail in, then would I have them, <hi>to ſet their hearts, and ſtomacks againſt all the feral paſſions, and bodily diſtempers they ſee in other men.</hi> What heating of the blood, and the vital ſpirits bee there in many Sailors? How are they tranſported with fierineſs of the eyes, inflamations of the face, furiouſneſs in their looks, extraordinary panting of the heart, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the pulſe, ſwelling of the veins, ſtammering of the tongue, gnaſhing of the teeth, bad language, and many other uncomly behaviours? Abhor theſe devilliſh geſtures that are in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of your pedling Sailors, bend your minds and ſpirits againſt them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a ſweet lovelineſs, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vertue there is in a milde, gentle, and unpaſſionate ſpirit. It is the very finew of all delightfull ſociety, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of humanity, and the very ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of civil converſe, it both draws love from others, and alſo keeps the heart in a perpetual calmneſs. If Sea-men love nothing but frowardneſs, and haſtineſs,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115438:98"/>
you that are wiſe will never take any delight in their company. It is ſtoried of <hi>Earl Elzearus,</hi> that hee was much given to immoderate anger, and the means hee uſed to cure this diſordered affection, was by ſtudying of Chriſt and of his patience, and this meditation hee would never let paſs from him before hee found his heart transformed and conformed into that heavenly pattern.</p>
               <p>But further, I have one word more, and that unto all the young Sea-men in <hi>England.</hi> It hath been my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that many thouſands of them are apt to bee ſpoiled and corrupted with that Soul-poyſoning ſociety they daily are in company of in the ſhips they ſail in, and could I now, or were I able to reſcue them out of the hands of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to fetch them off from under the <hi>noſe,</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of <hi>hell,</hi> and all the black powers of darkneſs, and alſo out of a diſlike unto all ungodly wretches, I ſhould then think my ſelf extreamly happy. To worke this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect amongſt them, I will give them a whole broad-ſide of Arguments, and if they will not doe, nothing in the world will prevail upon them; I may even then do as a Phyſician who hath ſtriven long with his patient and ſees no hopes, gives him up at laſt, I ſhall give you up for loſt men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of holding any intimate compliance and correſpondency with men
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115438:99"/>
that are publickly profane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <p>It is a very hard thing for a man to live amongſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fellows without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is eaſier to walk upon burning coales, or to carry fire in ones boſome, than to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch &amp; not bee tainted with them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.27.

                     <p>Though a man greatly like not the ſin, yet company with a ſinner may work him to it. <hi>Et quos vitium non potuit vince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, familiaritas vincit.</hi> Whom vice cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity will.</p>

                  <hi>and wicked.</hi> My reaſon is this, There evermore ſteals in upon that man that does not, a very ſecret, inſenſible, and undiſcernable dislike of his own former pious, ſober, and commendable courſes. Such a man in time wil begin to ſhake off his former ſtrictneſs, of piety, and innocency of life and converſation, and boldly ſay, I was but too ſtraight laced before, I will now have my youthfull liberty, and I am ſure that will bring mee in more pleaſure, and contentment in an hour, than my other life did in a whole year. It may bee thou wert a very civil, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſober-minded man before thou cameſt to Sea, but ſince it has been thy hap to fall in amongſt a pack of rude Sailors, as a drop that falls out of the clouds into the Ocean, thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of them. <hi>The ſweeteſt apples are ſooneſt corrupted, and beſt natures are quickly depraved:</hi> Sailor, Sailor live in all the ſhips thou goeſt in as fiſh in the Sea, who are both born, and bred in it, yet have no taſte at all of the ſalt-waters in them.

               <p n="2">2. He that has not a care of himſelf

herein, it is no wonder though there ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuates into that mans heart a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing approbation, and delightful aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and conſenting unto the ſinfull practices, ſenſual courſes, and wanton pleaſures and dalliances of ſuch men. God knows, many young men are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone, and led away into much ſoul-damning evil by keeping compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and following the counſel of rotten companions. <hi>Laus tribuenda Murenae, non quod Aſiam viderat, ſed quod in Aſia, continentur vixerat.</hi> That man is to bee commended that can live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily on ſhipboard, and wiſely turn away his back from all ſoul-poyſoning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.

               <p n="3">3. Hee that will not take this courſe, will in time find a reſolved, a fortified, and an habitual change in his affections and converſation. Bad ſociety will uſher in a transformation both of the mind, manners, and conditions of them with whom they do converſe. Oh the many youngmen that are ſlain by theſe filthy Sailors that uſe the Seas: <hi>Joſeph</hi> living in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſwear, and <hi>Peter</hi> in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts hall to curſe.

Now after this ſweet word of Advertiſement, which I hope may prove profitable, if the Lord ſet but in with it, let mee tell you thus much, that it is a very hard thing to live religiouſly at Sea, and therefore evermore look for theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wicked men will aſſault you, and make onſets and invaſions to ſhake you out of your profeſſion, and to fetter you in the ſame looſneſs of life they live in. Set your eyes upon theſe ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and reſiſt them with courage.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115438:102"/>
good that ever you ſhall meet withall in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wicked men are ſo far from God, and his wayes themſelves, that inſtead of taking delight in you for that good that is in you, you will finde hatred from them. It was a divine ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> That no man did ſet a better rate upon vertue, than hee that loſeth a good name to keep a good conſcience. <hi>In die praelii, naufragii, tempeſtatis, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, plus valebat Conſcientia pura, quam Marſupia plena.</hi> Boldly ſay unto all the wicked ones in the Sea, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115. <hi>Depart from mee, yee evil doers,</hi>

                  <hi>for I will keep the Commandements of my God.</hi> Beſtow thy affections upon the godly whom thou ſhalt live for ever with in the Kingdome of heaven, and not upon thoſe whom thou ſhalt never ſee more in the world to come, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee the better for in this life, but an hundred times the worſe.</p>

There was a vile wretch who had moſt injuriouſly abuſed the godly Martyr <hi>James Abbes,</hi> and after all his baſe uſage of him hee was ſhortly after taken with a ſtrange fit of phrenzie, and cried out, <hi>James Abbes is ſaved, and I am damned, James Abbes is ſaved, and I am damned!</hi> There is many a precious ſoul whom you hate

and ſpeak evil on ſhip-board that ſhall bee ſaved, when thouſands of you ſhall bee damned. I am damned may many a Saylor ſay, when ſuch a good man whom I ſlandered, and ſpoke evil of, is ſaved.</p>
               <p>Sailors rail on many a good man as cauſeleſly as dogs in the ſtreet upon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, unto whom a good man might ſay, what have I done to this Dog, that hee follows mee with this angry cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? had I rated him, or ſhaken my ſtaff at him, or ſtooped down to have taken up a ſtone to have thrown at the head of him, I had then juſtly drawn on this deformed noiſe; but what need I wonder to ſee this unquiet diſpoſition in a brute creature,<note place="margin">I would have Sea-Captains to follow <hi>Dominitian</hi> the Emperour, &amp; then ſhould they ſoon find few ſlanderers in their ſhips, his ſtomach ſo riſs againſt them, that he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them, but baniſhed them out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaying, <hi>That they which do not puniſh ſlanderers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them,</hi> Platina.</note> when it is no news with the reaſonable.

               <p n="1">1. Keep daily in thy boſome a good and quiet conſcience, or otherwiſe it will when thou comeſt unto the trial, gnaw out all the roots of valour out of thine heart.

               <p>I would have all the Sea-Captains, Maſters, Boatſwains, Gunners, Purſers, Carpenters, and Sea-men to prize a good conſcience in one caſe, as <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volus</hi> did in another, who ſaid when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered preferment by <hi>Juſtina</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Empreſs, if that hee would but bee an inſtrument of doing vile ſervice for her: <hi>What</hi> (ſaith hee) do you promiſe mee an higher place for a reward of iniquity? nay, take this away that I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

But to proceed.</p>
               <p>There bee two great evils that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve amongſt Sailors in the Seas, and I would deſire them to decline them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they will, and are ready to place themſelves in thoſe ſhips they know there is the leaſt religion, and where God has the leaſt ſervice, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo where there is not ſtrict and ſevere command. Here licentious and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs men love to bee. Oh what work is there amongſt the Sailors to bee cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this and the other ſhip when the Commander is a little ſtrict, and ſevere with them, in beating down their ſwearing, and their drunkenneſs! Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Sailor, Thou wouldeſt <hi>Hagar</hi>-like leave a good family, and fall into a worſe. But the Angel of the Lord bid her return.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many Sea-mens deſignes are to bee where wickedneſs may paſs free.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115438:106"/>
Thoſe ſhips, and Commands under which they can have their liberties to rant, ſwear, and bee drunk in, are the beſt Taverns they can put their heads, and noſes into. Good, and religious command in ſhips, is a burthen to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Sailors.</p>
               <p>There bee four evil things alſo to bee ſeen in moſt Captaines carriages in the Seas.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An heedleſneſs in keeping down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing paſſions.</hi> When rents, breaches, and diviſions are made in your ſhips, ſalve them up again, or elſe couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtamp them down.<note place="margin">It was a brave ſaying of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that hee could with one ſtamp of his foot quell the mutiny of an Army. One Sea-man is all fire, another all water, ſo that there is but little heat for God; One is a wing, and another is a weight, So that there bee many hindrances amongſt them to the worſhip of God, and very poor flights for Heaven. When a Commander in a ſhip holds forth no light amongſt his men, of a good converſation, I may ſay to ſuch an one, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29. The <hi>Sun</hi> is darkned, the <hi>Moon</hi> doth not give her light, and the Stars fall from Heaven in our ſhips. The <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines, and the <hi>Moon</hi> appears in ſome Commanders, but in other ſome not ſo much as a twinckling Star of any thing that it good. When the Fore-horſe in the traces will not draw forwards, but runs this way, and that way, he wrongs all the reſt. And thus does an irreligious Commander in a ſhip at Sea.</note> When <hi>Bees</hi> are out of their hives in a diſordered flight, then is the bell, or brazen mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alarm'd and ſtruck up to quell them again. Angry paſſions, and quarrels amongſt your Sailors will pull the whole ſhips companies, in pieces, and ſet them together by the eares.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A neglecting of enkindling their Sea-mens affections unto that which is good, and ſtirring of them up unto love,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115438:107"/>
and unity.</hi> The want of which is one ſtrong reaſon, why Sailors are ſo unfit for Morning, and Evening Prayer as they are every day. If there bee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of love and unity in your ſhips, there will bee no encouraging of one another in any zeal for God. When a ſhip is full of diſcord, it will bee ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more empty of all religious acts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A want of a Goſpel Spirit in ſpeaking often of God, and for God, amongſt their men.</hi> Captains and Sea-men ſhould be like the two Diſciples of Chriſt, that were going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> who talked, and conferred of all the things that had happened them, and whilſt they thus communed one with the other, in comes Chriſt amongſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A want of a Praying Spirit, and a ſpeaking often to God in Prayer with their Sea-men.</hi> If you have not Miniſters along with you, you have fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to call them unto that needful duty. Were your carriages good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſolid, ſound, and not ſo light, you might ſtamp that upon their ſpirits that would not rub out again a good while. Every Commander ſhould bee a pair of Oars in every ſhip hee goes in. He ſhould row, and labour till hee ſweat again if it were poſſible, to land all his men in Heaven, againſt wind, and tyde. But, God knows where is the Sea-Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that has his hand upon an Oar to ſave his Sailors. I wil tell you of enow
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115438:107"/>
that have their eyes, and their hands upon their Salary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> I will now leave you, all that I deſire, or all the harm I wiſh any of you is this, (if it can bee termed any) even to fear God in this life, and to amend what is amiſs, that you may ſee the Lord to comfort, and not to aſtoniſhment in the world to come. I will ſay unto you, as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid unto his Schollars, If I can but provoke you to learn, I have attained my end, after hee had followed them with elaborate inſtructions. If I can but do the like with you in provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perſwading of you to walk in theſe good counſels preſcribed, I ſhall greatly rejoyce in it. Theſe things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed I come unto the next thing in the words before mee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that in order to their poſture, <hi>going down,</hi> Two things would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and enquired into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is ſimply, and abſolutely to bee underſtood by <hi>going down</hi> into the waters, or how that ſailing may be ſaid to bee a <hi>going down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What poſitively, as to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and ingenious order, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in their <hi>going down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For their going down.</hi> Water (wee know) has its natural courſe, and tendency <hi>deorſum,</hi> and not <hi>ſurſum,</hi> downwards rather than upwards. How can it bee forced upwards that is <hi>contra
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115438:108"/>
naturam?</hi> When <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.7. That all Rivers go into the Sea, his meaning is, that they go down into a lower place than the land is of, and not up to an higher. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays that the earth is founded upon the Seas,<note place="margin">
                     <p>It is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome, that the Sea is far higher than the Land. And that a ſhip in the <hi>Chanel</hi> is as high as <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is well known that they that live beyond the line in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> that they never ſee the <hi>North-Star</hi> in their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they live ſo far below the heighth of it.</p>
                     <p>Mount <hi>Chego</hi> that great Spaniſh Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, may bee ſeen many leagues off in the Sea, &amp; yet in a little time may it ſoon bee run out of ſight. The <hi>Alps</hi> alſo (thoſe high <hi>Italian</hi> Mountains) and Mount <hi>Arrarat,</hi> may bee ſeen fifty or an hundred leagues out at Sea, ſay ſome which are far higher than the cloudy Regions, yet ſoon run out of ſight in a little time.</p>
                  </note> hee means that the earth is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above them, as it is made a fit, and convenient place of habitation. And the Learned underſtand the Hebrew word <hi>Gnal</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe as ſignifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and not below, in which ſenſe the waters that it ſuſtaines does not hold it, but are holden by it. Neither is water ſo heavy a body as earth is, yet heavy enough to deſcend, becauſe it is of no aſpiring nature, but preſſes eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the ſame center, that a ſtone, or any ponderous thing will do, and cannot therefore poſſibly be higher than the earth (though in ſome natural conſiderations I will not deny but that it is, and may) for, wee have Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeaking after this manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. When God gathered the waters, hee provided ſtations, and lodging places, or receptacles for them, leſt they ſhould return, and cover the earth as they did before, both at the Creation of the world, and alſo at that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115438:108"/>
time of the Deluge. And this appears by the Hebrew word <hi>Kavah,</hi> the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of which is to congregate, or gather together, from whence is that Latin derivative, <hi>Cavus</hi> hollow.

               <p>But now, in waging of war (leſt I ſhould bee miſunderſtood) there are evermore two things to bee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the wagers of it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A juſt cauſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>A right intention.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A juſt cauſe.</hi> This is primarily requiſite, leſt there ſhould bee a falling under the laſhing, and bitter reproof that is recorded with deteſtation in the Book of <hi>Pſalmes. They perſecuted mee
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115438:116"/>
without a cauſe.</hi> The cauſe ought to be juſt betwixt Nation and Nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is every light, and ſmall trivial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury a juſt cauſe of war; becauſe war is a thing that puniſhes men, with the greateſt, and grievouſeſt puniſhments that can bee. And beſides, war is not to bee undertaken but upon ſome injury, which is both great, and hainous, either in it ſelf or conſequences. And again, great and hainous injuries do not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant war, unleſs it bee after the trial and uſe of all the lawfull means that can be for peace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A right intention.</hi> The intention in the firſt place ſhould drive, and aim at the glory of God, and in the next, at the juſtice of war. War is not to bee waged out of paſſion, and hatred, but out of zeal for juſtice, that war may alwaies tend to a fit peace, and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as to its proper end and center.</p>
               <p>As for the inſtruments of war now that are to carry it on, when once it is begun, I conceive that they are of two ſorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Some very good and godly.</item>
                  <item>2. Otherſome very bad and wicked.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This cannot well bee helped in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars (in land-wars there is oftentimes better redreſs of things) for men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently godly, and well qualified are not to bee found to make Armies and Armado's of. And again, I think it is not unlawful that the worſt of men,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115438:116"/>
(yea the very ſcum and filth of the world) are employed. I find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſome of the forces of the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, which were no other than an unclean and ſtinking crew of men. Yet wicked, profane, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyſt men they ought to bee carefully avoided, and ejected out of Navies, Ships, Armies, Troops, and Regiments, becauſe they both bring great ſcandal upon a Nation, and upon their <hi>Generals, and Commanders;</hi> and that is not onely all neither, but hereby, where ſuch are either at Sea, or Land, there may the ſooner bee a looking for a curſe than a bleſſing in all their undertakings. And again, a war that is undertaken upon juſt and good grounds, It is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to uſe the help of thoſe who fight out of a bad intention, either out of hatred, violence, ambition, honour, or deſire of plunder; for their bad inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not violate the righteouſneſs of the cauſe. Is there not many Sea-Captains that fight for nothing in the world but their 10 pound and 15 pound <hi>per moneth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I may ſay of Sailors what one ſaid of <hi>Law, Logick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Switſers,</hi> They may bee hired to fight for any one. Sea man, Sea-man, get better princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> And is there not thouſands of Sea-men that fight for their 18. ſhillings <hi>per moneth?</hi> Nay, may I not ſay, that they would fight for the Devil would hee but give them better wages than the States do? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands bee there of them that are now fighting day by day (in one part or
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115438:117"/>
other of the world) and they know not what they fight for, ſave onely this, <hi>Saile ſhip, and come pay-day.</hi> They look not upon the glory of God, nor the cauſe that is in hand, againſt the proud oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Chriſt and his glorious and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel. And now I will not deny but that theſe will ſerve to goe on in the wars to do Chriſts work in the world withall, though hee hurl the rod into the fire after all is done. It is well known in all Hiſtories, that the traſh and trumpery of the world have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more gone in the wars, and indeed they are the fitteſt men to loſe their lives for the godly, and well-minded people in the world cannot well bee ſpared, and ſhould they bee ſlain, the world would ſuſtain great loſs in their deaths.</p>
               <p>But now what ſhall I ſay of all the wars that are on foot in the world, whether in the North, or in the Eaſt, in the South, or in the Weſt? May I not ſay, that ſin has made a man a very hurtful, and harmful creature; man is not now become hurtful to beaſts, and beaſts to man, but one man unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one Nation with, and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this has been ſo of old, and is no new thing ſtill, but likely to bee ſo, as long as there is ſo much of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the world, both acting and ruling in the ſons of men; as long as <hi>Pride</hi> ſhall bee ſeen exalted above the grace of <hi>Humility, Covetouſneſs</hi> above
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115438:117"/>
                  <hi>Contentedneſs, Luſt</hi> above <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Enmity</hi> above <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> never look for better in the world. Man till ſinfull was never thus hurtfull. Before hee ſinned was hee not naked, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared nor offered wrong, and will not his ſinleſs eſtate ever bee known by the ſtate of innocency? When that loſt Image of God comes once to bee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again in all men generally, and when the Kingdoms of the Earth ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, then ſhall there bee peace, and quietneſs in the Earth, that one may walk up and down in the world at pleaſure, but not till then. When mankind ſhall become a lamb, then will it bee a glorious age, and never till then. It is obſerved, that all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſave the lamb are armed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures providence, but the lamb is ſent into the world naked and un-armed, comes into it with neither offenſive nor defenſive weapons. When mankind comes once to receive the glorious Image of the Lord, then will there bee no longer this fighting, and contentious principle that is in the hearts of moſt men, but they will bee as meek and harmeleſs as the Dove, who in the <hi>Greek</hi> is called (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115438:118"/>
horn ſpoken of in Scripture? When that you ſee once the Lyons, Bears, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Wolves, and Tygers of the world to bee turned into Lambs, and their wolviſh, and Lion-like natures changed and metamorphoſed into a Dove-like meekneſs, then may it be ſaid that there is then new Heavens, and new Earth, and in the <hi>interim</hi> never look for a ceſſation of war in the world, till there bee ſome great Goſpel-work wrought in the Earth.</p>
               <p>But fourthly, That which now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in order, is, the conſideration of this word, <hi>Great waters.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord here takes great delight to put this diſtinguiſhing accent upon them, and indeed it is a very famous and glorious title that God is pleaſed to ſet upon their heads, <hi>Great waters:</hi> calling them <hi>great</hi> in oppoſition to ſmall Rivulets which the eyes of <hi>Inland</hi> dwellers are upon. It is a well known axiom in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> Set but contraries in the preſence of each other,<note place="margin">Oppoſita juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt.</note> and the difference is quickly made. Therefore in our ſpeaking of the <hi>Great waters,</hi> pray what are the <hi>Aquae Stagnantes</hi> in a Land? and what are the <hi>Fontaneae Scaturigines, ſive Torren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſive Fluvii maximi?</hi> What are the great Rivers, or the ſtanding pools, and running torrents of a Land in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the great and wide Ocean? As vaſt a diſproportion, and diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is there betwixt them, as there is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115438:118"/>
betwixt the ſhining Sun, and a twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtar, or betwixt the maſſy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and the little bodied Mouſe. The Spirit of the Lord titles them <hi>Great waters,</hi> and to ſpeak (<hi>re vera,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Legere &amp; non intelligere, eſt negligere.</note> 
                  <hi>in re ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeria</hi>) really, they are ſo, as I ſhall by and by declare upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts. They who have never ſeen the Seas, nor ever ſailed in them, and upon them, they cannot credit their magnitude, latitude, and longitude, and when they read over that 1 <hi>Chap. Gen.</hi> 9. (where God ſaid, <hi>Let the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the Heaven bee gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was ſo.</hi>) it is but tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, inconſiderately, and at the beſt unponderingly, for there is but few that mind, or apprehend what they read. Why, Theſe are <hi>waters</hi> indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they are little leſs in ſpatiouſneſs (nay if not greater) than the whole Earth, joyn all the ſmall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex pede Hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> (wee ſay) The skilful <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrician</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the length of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot upon the hill <hi>Olympus,</hi> made the portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of his whole body by it. You may judge of the Seas though you never ſaw them.</note> and great Iſlands and Continents that be either in the Eaſt and Weſt, North and South to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they are not ſo vaſt and large as the Seas bee. Now I know that many are very prone to deem this aſſertion as a thing not credible, becauſe of the weakneſs of their judgements; but that I may bring thoſe into a beleef of it that may call what is laid down here into queſtion, I will tell them what they ſhall do to put the thing out of all doubt and controverſie, even take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115438:119"/>
and make trial of it. Let the waters, ſaith God, bee gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at his word they fled, and tarried not for another word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but away they ran roaring and raging off the Land which they held in their poſſeſſion, till God gave them Commiſſion to give it up to mankinde, and the creatures the Lord intended to live in it, which were choyſer inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and ſo ever ſince that word of Command they have continued in thoſe Caves, Pits, Depths, Cells, and bottomleſs receptacles, which God out of wiſdome digged and delved for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.9. <hi>Thou haſt ſet a bound that they may not paſs over, that they turn not again to cover the earth.</hi>

the Muſicioners method in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this, for hee that playes upon the Harp, ſtrikes not upon one ſtring, but upon all, and that is it that makes the Muſick. The great waters then are of ſuch power, force, and ſtrength when the winds lift them up into ſwelling Hills and pyramidical Mountains, that they do no more value ſhips of a thouſand or ſixteen hundred Tun, than the wind vallues a light and unballaſted feather. The ſporting Student for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation bandies not his Tennis-ball with more facility from ſide to ſide, yea and ſometimes over the Court-wall, than the Seas do both the great and ſmall ſhips that they carry upon their ſhoulders.

wee are at this time handling and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from, doth naturally treat of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, as the vocation and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome men, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as have buſineſs in the great waters. And have not many men affairs and commerce betwixt Nation and Nation, to manage and diſpatch, which cannot any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bee either done or performed but by this art?

Now this vocation hath been an antient imployment, and of very long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continuance, it hath been in uſe before Chriſts time, and of uſe in his time, and ever ſince Chriſts coming into the world. Gods own people, the Jews, were very great Merchants (and ſo are all the Jews generally unto this day) the word <hi>Canaan</hi> ſignifies a Merchant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting, that they were not ordinary, but of the greateſt of Merchants.</p>
               <p>And God hath not prohibited, nor forbid men from coming upon the Seas, no more than hee did in thoſe times. If that this calling had been unlawful and unwarrantable, then <hi>Zebulun</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners Tribe would have been forbad it (Deut. 33.18. <hi>And of</hi> Zebulun <hi>hee ſaid, Rejoyce</hi> Zebulun <hi>in thy going out, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>For they ſhall ſuch of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

Some have their callings, ſtations, and habitations on Land, ſome again at Sea. Some are ingenious in one thing, and ſome again in another. All men have not the like equality of gifts, parts, and graces that otherſome have; and certainly one main end is, that they bee helpful to one another. <hi>Moſes</hi> had not the voluble tongue, therefore hee was beholden to <hi>Aaron</hi> to bee his prolocutor. God ſets men their bounds, and their work and task, whilſt they are in this world; ſome muſt go to Sea all their dayes, and other ſome not ſo much as ſet their footupon the Salt waters.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115438:125"/>
it is the judgement of the beſt <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> that the Moon by her operation ſets the Sea, the worlds great wonder, on ebbing and flowing. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe hee could not find out the natural cauſe of the Seas flowing, and ebbing, told the Sea, that if hee could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the reaſon of it, the Sea ſhould comprehend him, and out of grief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hee threw himſelf into the Sea. Others again think that the final cauſe of the Seas motion was ordained by God, for the purging, and preſerving of the waters, as the aire has its purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by, and from the winds, which are as brooms and beſoms to ſweep away all the contagious vapours, and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſavours that climb up into it. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding waters, wee know, are apt to putrify, corrupt, and ſtink, if it were not for ſweet ſprings that feed them; but what are ſmall Rivulets that are extracted, and ſtrained waters through the veins of the Earth (though out of all the Nations in the world) to the great and wide Sea? they are but as the drop of a bucket, or a mole-hill to a Mountain.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sea affords all mankind this great, ſingular, and publique benefit, in reſpect it yields them ſuch an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable variety of all ſorts and kinds of Fiſh, both great and ſmall, which is a great ſupply to many Towns, Cities, and Countries, both in the <hi>Eaſtern, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern,

If it ſhould bee demanded of mee what definition may bee given of the eye, and what it is, I think it may bee ſaid truly, that the eye is a little globe, that is very full of viſory ſpirits, which do exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the round animatedneſs of the world. The viſory ſpirits have their generation from the <hi>Animal,</hi> which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115438:141"/>
flows from the brain to the eye by the nerve Optic, and from thoſe proceed the viſible and reflected rayes in the eye, as in a glaſs which will ſoon form any image that it beholds, and ſo is received into the Chryſtalline humour, and by the viſory ſpirits through the Nerve Optic is conveyed to the brain the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bee conſidered of, and by, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſes, as imagination, memory, and the common ſenſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reptile. They that go down to the Sea in ſhips,</hi> Amongſt the reſt of thoſe delightful, and heart-taking objects that they have, that venemous creature, called a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> is one, which in form, and ſhape reſembles a <hi>Lobſter,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>They that go down to the Sea in ſhips,</hi> Amongſt the reſt of that <hi>amaene,</hi> and

               <p n="3">3.

The webs that theſe creatures do weave from tree to tree, are made of a perfect raw ſilk, ſo ſtrong with all, that birds of divers kindes are frequently caught in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>But to recall my ſelf, I will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate any further in this circumſtance, for it is not a little dolorous and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mee in an unmercifull element to write of things, when that the Sea will ſcarce ſuffer mee to hold

               <p n="5">5. That wonderful and admirable ſort of tree,<note place="margin">Cocus.</note> called a <hi>Cocus</hi> tree, which is ſeen in many parts of the world.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Mee thinks I hear the Country man ſaying is it thus, That there are ſuch hazzards in the Seas, and that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners are put to theſe heart-affrighting, and ſoul-conſternating dangers, I would not bee ſolicited to go to Sea if they would give mee the choyſeſt and coſt-lieſt ſhip that is in the world, for I ſhould conclude that if thoſe men that uſe the Seas bee ſo often at their wits end, I ſhould bee oftner at the end of mine. Are they in ſuch dangers that many times the Maſts break by the board upon their heads? Are they in ſuch jeopardy that their ſails tear in peeces like to white paper by the winds? Do the Seas come leaping over their <hi>Poop-lanthorns,</hi> and ſometimes over their yard arms? Are they ever and anon running upon ſands? And
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115438:266"/>
by, and by upon rocks? What would become of mee were I in the ſight of ſuch ſtorms? I confeſs, there is a vaſt diſproportion betwixt the Sea-mans, and the Land-mans life, becauſe the one is toſſed, and tumbled in a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sea, and the other is both night and day in quiet at land.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sea is full of dangers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Land is full of peace, and ſafety from thoſe perils that bee at Sea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sea is reſtleſs, and unquietly raging, but the land is ſtable, and firm, and quiet, becauſe it ſtands upon that uncontroulable Decree of the Lords.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is ſmall comfort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to bee had, or expected in the Sea,<note place="margin">The Sea is a great <hi>Element,</hi> in which both fiſh and fowl take great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to live, but there is none of the ſons of men, but take far more pleaſure in being at land. <hi>Englands</hi> Navy is not unlike to <hi>Davids</hi> Army, 1 Sam. 22.2. <hi>Every one that was in diſtreſs, every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcontented, gathered themſelves unto him.</hi> It is poverty makes many go to Sea.</note> but the land affords both a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and variety of it.</p>

Prayer at Sea, is like to a poor Beggar, or Traveller on Land, who goes from Town to Town, and from Country to Country, but is never invited in, or taken notice of by any. ſtrangers, and travellers, we uſually ſay, meet but with cold entertainment.

And when neglected, God ſhuts up the windows of heaven, and locks up the treaſuries of his bounty, and ſo lets Winds and Seas rage, and roar, and the creatures gnaſh and grin their teeth at a people for their ingratitude.

The Arguments why Sea-men ſhould praiſe God are briefly theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God had ſuch a ſpecial <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> eye and provident care over you, in the preſerving of you in all the unlikelieſt and irrecoverableſt dangers and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that you have been exerciſed withall in the Seas.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>That although a man hath nothing to ſpeak of Gods wonderful deliverances in the Seas, but what is known unto others, as well as to himſelf, yet is it a part of Gods praiſe, and of his thankfulneſs, to make Gods works known, and the continual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his talk and diſcourſe.

do what you can, you will dye in Gods debt. Now thankfulneſs ſtands not in words, and complements; if you would expreſs your thankfulneſs unto God <hi>Sirs,</hi> then do thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to come out of all your ſtorms, and Sea-dangers, as <hi>Job</hi> did out of his affliction, <hi>Job</hi> 23.10. <hi>When hee hath tried mee, I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi> It would bee a brave thing, that every Sailor that goes into the Furnace of a fiery, ſtormy, and raging Sea,<note place="margin">Beleeve it <hi>Sirs,</hi> God looks for it at your hands.

                  <hi>Ah Sirs,</hi> will not you be Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants all the daies of your lives, who has delivered you ſo often out of ſtorms, and raging Seas, and inevitable dangers?</p>
